# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

All development is based done against the current head of the master branch,
with releases being tagged periodically.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For BWIPP, most security bugs are "just bugs" so report them openly via the
issue tracker.

If you determine that the issue is so serious as to place users' systems at
grave risk then feel free to contact the author directly.
